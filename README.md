# IaaS-Performance-Change-Detection
This repository contains the dataset and sourcecode used for the paper entitled "IaaS Performance Signature Change Detection" which is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing.
Run the following files (according to the given order) to generate the results:
1. result_generation.m 
  - This generates the initial data, signatures, changed signatures. It then applies the proposed change detection techniques and stores their     performances.
2. graph_gen.m
  - This file produces the figures that display the performance comparision between different approaches.
